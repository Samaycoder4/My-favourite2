   <p>Hello Im Samay deb. My hobby is coding.In my free time i code.it is really fun
      to code. I learn new things everyday.The teacherswho teach coding are very polite, always trying to help and many more.they also teach in a amusing manner which fills my mind with enthusiasm. Whitehat Junior is a really good place to learn coding.<br><br>
 I have coded in many platforms: codepen.io; thunkable; code.org
       dialogueflow;brackets etc.There are many events, projects and quizez as well.I know i have some projects pending but i will try my best to complete them.</p>
